Separate combinational and sequential processes for Writefsm and Readfsm.
No data through readfsm and only the length goes through the Writefsm(not the entire data).
Some signal name changes.
Variables have been replaced with signals in the Writefsm.
Added an additional component(outreg.vhd) which receives data control signals from Writefsm and Readfsm.
